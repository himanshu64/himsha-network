# HIMSHA Network

> **DISCLAIMER: This project is for educational purposes only. It is NOT production-grade software. Do not use it with real Bitcoin mainnet funds. The ZK proofs, consensus mechanisms, and Bitcoin integration are proof-of-concept implementations that have not been audited or tested for production use.**

HIMSHA (Hashable Instruction Machine) is an experimental Bitcoin programmability layer. Every state transition is proven correct by a RISC Zero ZK receipt — not validator majority vote.

---

## Architecture

```
User → himsha-node (JSON-RPC :9100)
           ↓ RuntimeTransaction
       himsha-vm (RISC Zero zkVM)
           ↓ ZK receipt + new account state
       himsha-runtime (account model, UTXO anchoring)
           ↓ commit state to Bitcoin UTXO
       Bitcoin L1 (final settlement)
```

Unlike consensus-only systems, HIMSHA uses ZK proofs to guarantee program correctness independently of validator honesty.

---

## Implementation Status

A snapshot of the core security model. **Done** = implemented and enforced, covered by
the Rust test suite (182 tests, `cargo test --workspace`). **Under testing / partial** =
the mechanism exists but isn't fully hardened, or needs an external system (the RISC Zero
toolchain or a Bitcoin regtest node) to exercise end-to-end.

### ✅ Done (enforced + unit-tested)

| Area | What's enforced |
|------|-----------------|
| **Transaction signatures** | BIP-340 Schnorr (secp256k1); the node rejects unsigned, forged, or tampered transactions at ingestion. |
| **Replay protection** | Signed `recent_blockhash` + `chain_id`, recent-window expiry, and txid de-duplication. |
| **Writable enforcement** | `write_data` refuses to mutate an account an instruction declared read-only. |
| **Owner enforcement** | Every write is owner-gated post-execution: a program may only change accounts it owns (plus lamport credits and first-writer claims on blank accounts). Enforced CPI-aware at every invocation boundary, in native dispatch, the zkVM guest, and on deployed-program output. |
| **CPI depth limit** | Nested cross-program calls bounded (`MAX_CPI_DEPTH = 4`) — no stack-blow DoS. |
| **Atomic state** | A transaction's account writes commit in a single DB transaction (all-or-nothing). |
| **ZK receipt binding** | The node persists a state transition only if its receipt commits to exactly the accounts produced (native integrity gate); the zkVM path additionally rejects a guest that returns a different account table than it was given. |
| **Programs** | system, token, ATA, swap (AMM), lending, money-market (interest-bearing cToken lender shares, kinked rate model, close-factor-bounded liquidation, staleness-gated oracle price), yield vault (lends idle assets via CPI, deposits **and** withdrawals priced off live on-chain NAV, auto-undeploy on withdraw), NFT metadata, runes, oracle (multi-publisher median + per-step deviation bound). |

### 🧪 Under testing / partial

| Area | Status |
|------|--------|
| **ZK proving (soundness)** | Native execution is integrity-checked but not cryptographically proven. The verified-receipt path needs the RISC Zero toolchain (`--features zkvm`); `proof_bytes` currently holds the journal, not a re-verifiable STARK seal. |
| **Compute metering** | CPI depth *and* fan-out width are bounded (per-instruction compute budget charged at every invocation). Arbitrary in-program loops *inside* a single program are still bounded only on the zkVM path (cycle limit), not native dispatch. |
| **Execution timing** | Per-tx writes are atomic, but execution still happens at RPC time (before block inclusion); moving it to block production remains. |
| **Bitcoin L1 anchoring** | Each block carries a Merkle `state_root` over the account table (bound into the blockhash); the producer commits it to Bitcoin via OP_RETURN every `HIMSHA_ANCHOR_INTERVAL` blocks, and `himsha_getStateProof` serves inclusion proofs (verifiable client-side — see the TS SDK `verifyAccountInState`). Followers recompute the root after replication and flag divergence. End-to-end OP_RETURN broadcast needs a funded regtest wallet to verify. |
| **Consensus replication** | Raft *election* safety only — no log replication / commit index; followers re-derive by polling the leader. |
| **Threshold custody** | FROST/Taproot committee is now *wired into settlement*: set `HIMSHA_THRESHOLD="M/N"` and inscription settlements are threshold-signed via a Taproot key-spend (else single hot wallet). The in-process committee co-locates all shares (educational, not real custody decentralization) and end-to-end Bitcoin acceptance is still unverified without a regtest node funding the committee address (`himsha_getCustodyInfo`). |
| **Lightning** | Requires an external LND node; unverified without one. |

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.87+ (workspace MSRV, gated in CI)
- Bitcoin Core (regtest for local dev)
- RISC Zero toolchain: `cargo install cargo-risczero && cargo risczero install`

### Build

```bash
cargo build --workspace
```

### Run a local node

```bash
HIMSHA_DB=./him.redb cargo run -p himsha-node
# Node listens on http://127.0.0.1:9100
```

### CLI

```bash
# Check node status
himsha node status

# Deploy a program
himsha deploy --elf ./target/deploy/my_program.so --image-id <hex>

# Query an account
himsha account get <pubkey>

# Get current slot
himsha node slot
```

### JSON-RPC

All methods use `http://localhost:9100` with `Content-Type: application/json`:

```bash
# Check readiness
curl -X POST http://localhost:9100 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"himsha_isNodeReady","params":[]}'

# Get slot
curl -X POST http://localhost:9100 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"himsha_getSlot","params":[]}'
```

## Program execution (native vs. zkVM)

Each built-in program is a plain Rust crate exposing `process()`. There are two execution paths:

- **Native dispatch** (default today) — the node runs built-in programs directly via
  [`himsha-vm::dispatch`](himsha-vm/src/dispatch.rs). Execution is deterministic and produces the
  same state transition the guest would, but **skips proof generation** (the receipt is marked
  `verified: false`). This lets the node run end-to-end without the RISC Zero toolchain.
- **zkVM proving** — deployed (non-built-in) programs, and built-ins once compiled to guest ELFs,
  run through `ProgramExecutor::execute` which generates and verifies a RISC Zero receipt.

Enable proving for **all** programs (built-ins via a universal RISC Zero guest) with the opt-in
`zkvm` feature — this requires the RISC Zero toolchain (`cargo-risczero` + `r0vm`):

```bash
cargo run -p himsha-node --features zkvm
```
